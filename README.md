# small-recipe-website-oop

This is a remake of another project of mine called "small-recipe-list-website" and that originally started as a school project that I would expand. This time the data and the idea remains the same but the code starts from scratch.

The endgoal from this program is to learn how to remake this project entirely with PHP classes.

It uses:
1. PHP 8.2.1.2
2. HTML5/CSS3
3. Bootstrap v5.3

The old project can be found at: https://github.com/ArieKh33/Small-recipe-list-website
